To authorize the access to the data on Google Cloud, the supervisor needs to set the authorisations parameter of the project data folder. To do so, go on Google Cloud, in the 'ds2class' project. Then click on the bucket 'project10_tc_sar', then 'authorisation' tab. Then click on 'Add'. In 'New Principal Account', write 'allUsers'. In 'Role', select 'Cloud Storage' then 'Read objects from storage'. Then add the authorisation and save. Now students should have access to the data using the notebook code.
